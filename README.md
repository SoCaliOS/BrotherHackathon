# BrotherHackathon
Brother Hackathon March 23rd 2018
Welcome! This is a public folder for all who are interested. We do encourage everyone to register for the event and welcome your presence in Irvine on March 23rd and 24th, 2018, with prizes.
To facilitate questions from registered participants who need additional help with coding, we will upload the codes so everyone can view, learn, and contribute.
